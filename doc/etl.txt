*etl* ETL help file.



todo                   *e-todo*

		implement a process-group value - add column to etl_process
		will need a function/script to get a  etl_process_key

		myslq dump of jiveMessage ( 1433626 records ) piped to etl DB took 37 minutes  

		test filemodified on large numbers
		organize
		docs

		lft-rgt stuff for navigation_bridge

		http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2

		?? call mysql -e "load data"   in a sh script
		or force it through cloverETL.
		I prefer the shell script .. for now  
		fetch the etl database info from etl_back_room
		and parameerize.

		message_transaction_fact


		add a process to do referrals before clickstream - 
			from the same data files.
		(maybe do these as clickstream is processed )
			I think so....


			process deleted tables

			getMessagePropip.sql  getUserProphomepage.sql   ... need to
			be organzied into a process call


			filter access.log for unique page_uri -> update_dim
			by testing against current lookup
			same for referrals - 

			run these before clickstream
			somthing weird on tickstodate between 
			messagetrans ( output = string)
		and clickstream (output = date)


			add update when loookup fails 
			for page_dim,useragent_dim
